#How to Run

Run the server first then the client.

Each tab in the browser will count as a client, and will be terminated once refreshed or closed.

The first person to create the room will be in charge of controlling the video.

#Problems to solve

-If the person in charge disocnnects, no one takes his/her place.

-All the users should be in the room before the video plays for the first time. Late users will have problems with the synchronization.
